# How to draw koch fractal:

Drawing this fractal is the simplest I think.

To make this fractal you will need three functions:

## Step1:

After giving your input the first function scales it to 1/3

## Step2:

Then The rotation function should rotate the scaled line 60 deg.

## Step3:

In this step we will need another rotator function to rotate the point generated in the previous step -120 deg.

## Last step:

you just need to rotate the point generated in step3 +60 deg and concatinate the segments.

now if you plot the output you will see a nice koch fractal on your screen
