my method to draw the dragon fractal is combination of rotation and origin transmition.
# Rotatoin
If you look carefully to a dragon curve you can easily see that in each step the previous step must be rotated ** along its first point**
with magnitude of 45 deg.
Then the result must be rotated along its last point with magnitude of -90 deg.

Now two sections must be concatinated and then you should repeat the process on the concatinated array
